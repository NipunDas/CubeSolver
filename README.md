# CubeSolver

Project is designed to solve the cube using CFOP (with EO done in the beginning to simplify the code for the rest). Current goal is to get a solving algorithm which is not
necessarily very efficient (around 60-70 moves) but is functional, and could be implemented in a Rubik's Cube Solver.
